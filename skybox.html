										The first video is of a skybox that I made for SyncVR's "Medical Hypnosis" application. 
										This was my first time trying to make a skybox so it seemed easier to make it with nodes rather than with code. 
										I started by making the actual sky gradient and moved on from there. Adding the additional elements as I went on. 
										The video on the right shows what nodes I used and how I kept them organized. The most difficult part of this shader was keeping track of what node did what. 
										I tried my best to label all of them. In the future, I will add more modularity when making big shades. 
										I will also highlight connections that separate each element.

										</span>

										Turned out that the VR device that I was developing this skybox for didn't work with the URP that Unity offers. 
										So I tried my best to remake the shader into an HLSL code-based shader. I'd never tried coding a skybox before, so this would be an awesome learning experience. 
										I quickly learned that making a skybox is very different than making a shader for a piece of geometry. You don't have any physical reference points. 
										making a skybox was very abstract for me and helped me a lot with learning HLSL. 
										The most difficult part of this project was getting the clouds to move in a parabolic matter so that they didn't seem to "flat". 
										After making this project I feel like I know a lot more about HLSL and how its positioning works

												I like winter and snow. So to get in the mood for winter I started working on this project.<br />
												My goal is to make a realistic winter wonder land that I can keep on expanding while I learn.
